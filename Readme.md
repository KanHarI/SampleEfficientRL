# Sample Efficient RL

This repo is eventually intended to be an RL agent playing Slay The Spire.

Currently, what I have is a CLI of a simple version (Ironclad starter vs Cultist) that I can use to test the framework.

## How to run
* Create a venv:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
* Activate the venv:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
* Install the package:
```bash
./build_lint_and_test.sh
```
* Run the CLI:
```bash
play_simple
```
