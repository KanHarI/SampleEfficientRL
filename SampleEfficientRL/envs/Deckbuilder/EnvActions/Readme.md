"EnvActions" are different from "Actions".

"Actions" are performed by the agent; "EnvActions" are internal to the environment and are a way to modify the state of the environment. For example, attacking an enemy is an EnvAction. If the vulnerable status is applied to that enemy, it catches this action and modifies it.
